# My Professional Portfolio - v2

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio, accessible at [www.jonathanzul.me](https://www.jonathanzul.me/).

This project is a full-stack application built from the ground up to showcase my skills. It's designed, developed, and maintained by me.

## Tech Stack & Architectural Choices

This portfolio is built with a stack that reflects current industry best practices for performance, scalability, and developer experience.

- **Language:** **TypeScript** for robust type-safety and maintainability.
- **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (hosted on Vercel) with **Prisma ORM** for type-safe database access.
- **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first styling workflow.
- **UI Components:** **Shadcn/UI** for its collection of accessible and unstyled base components.
- **Deployment:** **Vercel** for seamless CI/CD, hosting, and serverless functions.
- **Email:** **React Email & Resend** for the contact form's back-end mailer service.
- **CMS:** **Sanity.io** for headless content management for the blog section.
